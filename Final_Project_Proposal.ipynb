    "We use mostly in the dataset in the nba official site with nba_api. We decided the possible datasets we will use. However we do not know which dataset is optimal. The main dataset is the set above. Firstly we will observe which data is meaninful for us and then we will combine our code and statistical foresight in order to them. The main dataset we have talked about is the set of the all games that played. The dataset contain the points, field goal percentage (with the number of attempt and made), 3 point percentage (with the number of attempt and made), free throw percentage (with the number of attempt and made), offensive rebound, deffansive reboun, total rebound, steal, block of each team in the game. We could not find out how to pull the actual data we have talked about yet. But we will find out or find similar data."

    "We will ask the data how many points may be scored in the future matches. Our hypothesis is we can guess how many score can be made in future matches by analysing the data of previous matches. In bet there are two options for score number. One is higher than a number like 210 other one is lower than it. In this project we try to obtain which is probable. The bet rate is constant which is 1.70. If we have a higher rate of 58% for our guesses we cannot lose money. We will do this guesse by using logistic regression."
